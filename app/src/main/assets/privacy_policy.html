<p>Depending on the Rideshare services that you use, and your app settings or device permissions, Rideshare may collect your precise or approximate location information as determined through data such as GPS, IP address and WiFi.</p>

<p>If you are a driver, Rideshare collects location information when the Rideshare app is running in the foreground (app open and on-screen) or background (app open but not on screen) of your device.</p>

<p>Riders may use the Rideshare app without enabling Rideshare to collect their location information.</p>

<p>However, this may affect the functionality available on your Rideshare app. For example, if you do not enable Rideshare to collect your location information, you will have to manually enter your pickup address. In addition, location information will be collected from the driver partner during your trip, even if you have not enabled Rideshare to collect your location information.</p>

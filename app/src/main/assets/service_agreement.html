You acknowledge and agree that you are required to fulfill a request for Transportation Services using the Driver App at least once a month to maintain an active Driver profile and Rideshare reserves the right to deactivate your Driver ID if you have not fulfilled a request for Transportation Services using the Driver App at least once a month.

    <li>2.2 <strong>Provision of Transportation Services.</strong> When the Driver App is active, User requests for Transportation Services may appear to you via the Driver App if you are available and in the vicinity of the User. If you accept a User’s request for Transportation Services, Rideshare Services will provide you with certain User Information via the Driver App, including the User’s first name and pickup location. It is recommended that you wait at least ten (3) minutes for a User to show up at the requested pick-­‐up location. You will obtain the destination from the User, either in person upon pickup or from the Driver App if the User elects to enter such destination via Rideshare’s mobile application. You acknowledge and agree that once you have accepted a User’s request for Transportation Services, Rideshare’s mobile application may provide certain information about you to the User, including your first name, contact information, photo and location, and your Vehicle’s make and license plate number. You shall not contact any Users for any reason except for the purposes of fulfilling Transportation Services. As between Rideshare and you, you acknowledge and agree that: (a) you shall be solely responsible for determining the most effective, efficient and safe manner to perform each instance of Transportation Services; and (b) except for Rideshare Services or any Rideshare Devices (if applicable), you shall provide all necessary equipment, tools and other materials, at your own expense, necessary to perform Transportation Services.</li>

Rideshare is not responsible or liable for the actions or inactions of a User in relation to your activities or your Vehicle.

You acknowledge and agree that you are solely responsible for taking such precautions as may be reasonable and proper (including maintaining adequate insurance that meets the requirements of all applicable laws) regarding any acts or omissions of a User or third party. You acknowledge and agree that Rideshare may release your contact and/or insurance information to a User upon such User’s reasonable request. You acknowledge and agree that, unless specifically consented to by a User, you may not transport or allow inside your Vehicle individuals other than a User and any individuals authorized by such User, during the performance of Transportation Services for such User. You acknowledge and agree that all Users should be transported directly to their specified destination, as directed by the applicable User, without unauthorized interruption or unauthorized stops.</li>
    <li>2.4 <strong>Your Relationship with Rideshare.</strong> You acknowledge and agree that Rideshare’s provision to you       of the Driver App and Rideshare Services creates a direct business relationship between Rideshare and you. Rideshare does not, and shall not be deemed to, direct or control you generally or in your performance under this Agreement specifically, including in connection with your provision of Transportation Services, your acts or omissions, or your operation and maintenance of your Vehicle. You retain the sole right to determine when and for how long you will utilize the Driver    App or Rideshare Services. You retain the option, via the Driver App, to attempt to accept or to decline or ignore a User’s request for Transportation Services via Rideshare Services, or to cancel an accepted request for Transportation Services via the Driver App, subject to Rideshare’s then-­‐ current cancellation policies. With the exception of any signage required by local law or permit/license requirements, Rideshare shall have no right to require you to: (a) display Rideshare’s or any of its Affiliates’ names, logos or colors on your Vehicle(s); or (b) wear a uniform or any other clothing displaying Rideshare’s or any of its Affiliates’ names, logos or colors. You acknowledge and agree that you have complete discretion to provide services or otherwise engage in other business or employment activities.  For the sake of clarity, you understand that you retain the complete right to; (i) use other software application services in addition to Rideshare Services; and (ii) engage in any other occupation or business.  Rideshare retains the right to, at any time  at  Rideshare's  sole  discretion,  deactivate or otherwise  restrict you from accessing or using the Driver App or Rideshare Services in the event of a violation of this Agreement, your disparagement of Rideshare or any of its Affiliates, your act or  omission  that causes harm to Rideshare’s or its Affiliates’ brand, reputation or business as  determined  by Rideshare in its sole discretion, or for any other reason at the reasonable discretion of Rideshare.</li>

        <ul style="list-style: none;">
            <li>2.5.1   You acknowledge and agree that: (a) after receiving Transportation Services, a User will be prompted by Rideshare’s mobile application to provide a rating of you and such Transportation Services and, optionally, to provide comments or feedback about you and such Transportation Services; and (b) after providing Transportation Services, you will be prompted by the Driver App to provide a rating of the User and, optionally, to provide comments or feedback about the User.

In the event your average rating falls below the Minimum Average Rating, Rideshare will notify you and may provide you, in Rideshare’s discretion, a limited period of time to raise your average rating above the Minimum Average Rating. If you do not increase your average rating above the Minimum Average Rating within the time period allowed (if any), Rideshare reserves the right to deactivate your access to the Driver App and Rideshare Services. Additionally, you acknowledge that your repeated failure to accept User requests for Transportation Services while you are logged in to the Driver App creates a negative experience for Users of Rideshare’s mobile application. If you do not wish to accept User requests for Transportation Services for a period of time, you will log off of the Driver App.</li>
            <li>2.5.3   Rideshare and its Affiliates reserve the right to use, share and display your and User ratings and comments in any manner in connection with the business of Rideshare and its Affiliates without attribution to you or your approval. You acknowledge and agree that Rideshare and its Affiliates are distributors (without any obligation to verify) and not publishers of your and User ratings and comments, provided that Rideshare and its Affiliates reserve the right to edit or remove comments in the event that such comments include obscenities or other objectionable content, include an individual’s name or other personal information, or violate any privacy laws, other applicable laws, or Rideshare’s or its Affiliates’ content policies.</li>

The foregoing license grant shall immediately terminate, and you will delete and fully remove the Driver App from the Driver-­‐Provided Device in the event that you cease to provide Transportation Services using Your Device. You agree that: (i) use of the Driver App on Your Device requires an active data plan with a wireless carrier associated with Your Device, which data plan will be provided by you at your own expense; and (ii) use of the Driver App on Your Device as an interface with Rideshare Services may consume very large amounts of data through the data plan. <strong>RIDESHARE ADVISES THAT YOUR DEVICE ONLY BE USED UNDER A DATA PLAN WITH UNLIMITED OR VERY HIGH DATA USAGE LIMITS AND RIDESHARE SHALL NOT BE RESPONSIBLE OR LIABLE FOR ANY FEES, COSTS, OR OVERAGE CHARGES ASSOCIATED WITH ANY DATA PLAN.</strong></li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>2.7 <strong>Location Based Services.</strong> You acknowledge and agree that your geo-­‐location information must be provided to Rideshare Services via a Device in order to provide Transportation Services. You acknowledge and agree that: (a) your geo-­‐location information will be monitored and tracked by Rideshare Services when you are logged into the Driver App and available to receive requests for Transportation Services or when you are providing Transportation Services; and (b) the approximate location of your Vehicle will be displayed to the User before and during the provision of Transportation Services to such User.

Rideshare shall, upon request, be entitled to review such licenses, permits, approvals, authority, registrations and certifications from time to time, and your failure to provide or maintain any of the foregoing shall constitute a material breach of this Agreement.</li>
</ul>

<h3>4.  Financial Terms</h3>

<ul style="list-style: none;">
    <li>4.1 <strong>Fare Calculation and Your Payment.</strong> You are entitled to charge a fare for each instance of completed Transportation Services provided to a User that are obtained via Rideshare Services (“Fare”), where such Fare is calculated based upon a base fare amount plus mileage and/or time amounts, as detailed for the applicable Territory (“Fare Calculation”). You are also entitled to charge User for any Tolls, taxes or fees incurred during the provision of Transportation Services, and, if applicable. You: (i) appoint Rideshare as your limited payment collection agent solely for the purpose of accepting the Fare, applicable Tolls and, depending on the region and/or if requested by you, applicable taxes and fees from the User on your behalf via the payment processing functionality facilitated by Rideshare Services; and (ii) agree that payment made by User to Rideshare shall be considered the same as payment made directly by User to you. In addition, the parties acknowledge and agree that as between you and Rideshare, the Fare is a recommended amount, and the primary purpose of the pre-­‐arranged Fare is to act as the default amount in the event you do not negotiate a different amount. You shall always have the right to: (i) charge a fare that is less than the pre-­‐arranged Fare; or (ii) negotiate, at your request, a Fare that is lower than the pre-­‐arranged Fare (each of (i) and (ii) herein, a “Negotiated Fare”). Rideshare shall consider all such requests from you in good faith. Rideshare agrees to remit to you on at least a weekly basis: (a) the Fare less the applicable Service Fee; (b) the Tolls; and (c) depending on the region, certain taxes and ancillary fees. If you and Rideshare have separately agreed, Rideshare may deduct other amounts from the Fare prior to remittance to you.</li>
    <li>4.2 <strong>Changes to Fare Calculation.</strong> Rideshare reserves the right to change the Fare Calculation at any time in Rideshare’s discretion based upon local market factors and Rideshare will provide you with notice in the event of such change that would result in a change in the recommended Fare for each instance of completed Transportation Services. Continued use of Rideshare Services after any such change in the Fare Calculation shall constitute your consent to such change.</li>
    <li>4.3 <strong>Fare Adjustment.</strong> Rideshare reserves the right to: (i) adjust the Fare for a particular instance of Transportation Services (e.g., you took an inefficient route, you fail to properly end a particular instance of Transportation Services in the Driver App, technical error in Rideshare Services, etc.); or (ii) cancel the Fare for a particular instance of Transportation Services (e.g., User is charged for Transportation Services that were not provided, in the event of a User complaint, fraud, etc.). Rideshare’s decision to reduce or cancel the Fare in any such manner shall be exercised in a reasonable manner.</li>
    <li>4.4 <strong>Service Fee.</strong> In consideration of Rideshare’s provision of the Driver App and Rideshare Services for your use and benefit hereunder, you agree to pay Rideshare a service fee on a per Transportation Services transaction basis calculated as a percentage of the Fare (regardless of any Negotiated Fare), as provided or otherwise made available by Rideshare from time to time for the applicable Territory (“Service Fee”). In the event regulations applicable to your Territory require taxes to be imputed in the Fare, Rideshare shall calculate the Service Fee based on the Fare net of such taxes. Rideshare reserves the right to change the Service Fee at any time in Rideshare’s discretion based upon local market factors and Rideshare will provide you with notice in the event of such change. Continued use of Rideshare Services after any such change in the Service Fee calculation shall constitute your consent to such change.</li>
    <li>4.5 <strong>Cancellation Charges.</strong> You acknowledge and agree that Users may elect to cancel requests for Transportation Services that have been accepted by you via the Driver App at any time prior to your arrival. In the event that a User cancels an accepted request for Transportation Services, Rideshare may charge the User a cancellation fee on your behalf. If charged, this cancellation fee shall be deemed the Fare for the cancelled Transportation Services for the purpose of remittance to you hereunder.</li>
    <li>4.6 <strong>Receipts.</strong> As part of Rideshare Services, Rideshare provides you a system for the delivery of receipts to Users for Transportation Services rendered. Upon your completion of Transportation Services for a User, Rideshare prepares an applicable receipt and issues such receipt to the User via email on your behalf. Such receipts are also provided to you via email or online portal. Receipts include the breakdown of amounts charged to the User for Transportation Services and may include specific information about you, including your name, contact information and photo, as well as a map of the route you took. Any corrections to a User’s receipt for Transportation Services must be submitted to Rideshare in writing within three (3) business days after the completion of such Transportation Services. Absent such a notice, Rideshare shall not be liable for any mistakes in or corrections to the receipt or for recalculation or disbursement of the Fare.</li>
    <li>4.7 <strong>No Additional Amounts.</strong> You acknowledge and agree that, for the mutual benefit of the parties, through advertising and marketing, Rideshare and its Affiliates may seek to attract new Users to Rideshare and to increase existing Users’ use of Rideshare’s mobile application. You acknowledge and agree such advertising or marketing does not entitle you to any additional monetary amounts beyond the amounts expressly set forth in this Agreement.</li>
    <li>4.8 <strong>Taxes.</strong> You acknowledge and agree that you are responsible for collecting and remitting all applicable gross receipts, sales and use, excise or any other transaction tax on the provision of Transportation Services.</li>

You agree to provide Rideshare and its Affiliates a copy of the insurance policy, policy declarations, proof of insurance identification card and proof of premium payment for the insurance policy required in this Section 8.1 upon request.

    <li>8.3 You understand and acknowledge that your personal automobile insurance policy may not afford liability, comprehensive, collision, medical payments, personal injury protection, uninsured motorist, underinsured motorist, or other coverage for the Transportation Services you provide pursuant to this Agreement.

    <li>8.4 Rideshare may maintain during the term of this Agreement insurance related to your provision of Transportation Services as determined by Rideshare in its reasonable discretion, provided that Rideshare and its Affiliates are not required to provide you with any specific insurance coverage for any loss to you or your Vehicle.

</ul>

<h3>15.3    Arbitration Provision</h3>

<p><strong>Important Note Regarding this Arbitration provision:</strong></p>

<ul>
    <li>Arbitration does not limit or affect the legal claims you may bring against Rideshare. Agreeing to arbitration only affects where any such claims may be brought and how they will be resolved.</li>
    <li>Arbitration is a process of private dispute resolution that does not involve the civil courts, a civil judge, or a jury. Instead, the parties’ dispute is decided by a private arbitrator selected by the parties using the process set forth herein. Other arbitration rules and procedures are also set forth herein.</li>
    <li>Unless the law requires otherwise, as determined by the Arbitrator based upon the circumstances presented, you will be required to split the cost of any arbitration with Rideshare.</li>
    <li>IMPORTANT: This arbitration provision will require you to resolve any claim that you may have against Rideshare MNM Technologies LLC or Rideshare on an individual basis pursuant to the terms of the Agreement unless you choose to opt out of the arbitration provision. This provision will preclude you from bringing any class, collective, or representative action against Rideshare or Rideshare. It also precludes you from participating in or recovering relief under any current or future class, collective, or representative action brought against Rideshare by someone else.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>WHETHER TO AGREE TO ARBITRATION IS AN IMPORTANT BUSINESS DECISION. IT IS YOUR DECISION TO MAKE, AND YOU SHOULD NOT RELY SOLELY UPON THE INFORMATION PROVIDED IN THIS AGREEMENT AS IT IS NOT INTENDED TO CONTAIN A COMPLETE EXPLANATION OF THE CONSEQUENCES OF ABRITRATION. YOU SHOULD TAKE REASONABLE STEPS TO CONDUCT FURTHER RESEARCH AND TO CONSULT WITH OTHERS — INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO AN ATTORNEY — REGARDING THE CONSEQUENCES OF YOUR DECISION, JUST AS YOU WOULD WHEN MAKING ANY OTHER IMPORTANT BUSINESS OR LIFE DECISION.</strong></p>

<h3>i.  How This Arbitration Provision Applies.</h3>

<p>This Arbitration Provision is governed by the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. § 1 et seq. (the “FAA”) and evidences a transaction involving commerce. This Arbitration Provision applies to any dispute arising out of or related to this Agreement or termination of the Agreement and survives after the Agreement terminates. Nothing contained in this Arbitration Provision shall be construed to prevent or excuse you from utilizing any procedure for resolution of complaints established in this Agreement (if any), and this Arbitration Provision is not intended to be a substitute for the utilization of such procedures.</p>

<p><strong>Except as it otherwise provides, this Arbitration Provision is intended to apply to the resolution of disputes that otherwise would be resolved in a court of law or before a forum other than arbitration. This Arbitration Provision requires all such disputes to be resolved only by an arbitrator through final and binding arbitration on an individual basis only and not by way of court or jury trial, or by way of class, collective, or representative action.</strong></p>

<p>Such disputes include without limitation disputes arising out of or relating to interpretation or application of this Arbitration Provision, including the enforceability, revocability or validity of the Arbitration Provision or any portion of the Arbitration Provision. All such matters shall be decided by an Arbitrator and not by a court or judge.</p>

<p>Except as it otherwise provides, this Arbitration Provision also applies, without limitation, to disputes arising out of or related to this Agreement and disputes arising out of or related to your relationship with Rideshare, including termination of the relationship. This Arbitration Provision also applies, without limitation, to disputes regarding any city, county, state or federal wage-­‐hour law, trade secrets, unfair competition, compensation, breaks and rest periods, expense reimbursement, termination, harassment and claims arising under the Uniform Trade Secrets Act, Civil Rights Act of 1964, Americans With Disabilities Act, Age Discrimination in Employment Act, Family Medical Leave Act, Fair Labor Standards Act, Employee Retirement Income Security Act (except for claims for employee benefits under any benefit plan sponsored by Rideshare and covered by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 or funded by insurance), Genetic Information Non-­‐Discrimination Act, and state statutes, if any, addressing the same or similar subject matters, and all other similar federal and state statutory and common law claims.</p>

<p>This Agreement is intended to require arbitration of every claim or dispute that lawfully can be arbitrated, except for those claims and disputes which by the terms of this Agreement are expressly excluded from the Arbitration Provision.</p>

<p>The parties expressly agree that Rideshare is an intended third-­‐party beneficiary of this Arbitration Provision.</p>

<h3>ii. Limitations On How This Agreement Applies.</h3>

<p>The disputes and claims set forth below shall not be subject to arbitration and the requirement to arbitrate set forth in this Arbitration Provision shall not apply:</p>

<p>Claims for workers compensation, state disability insurance and unemployment insurance benefits;</p>

<p>Regardless of any other terms of this Arbitration Provision, claims may be brought before, and remedies awarded by an administrative agency if applicable law permits access to such an agency notwithstanding the existence of an agreement to arbitrate. Such administrative claims include without limitation claims or charges brought before the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (www.eeoc.gov), the U.S. Department of Labor (www.dol.gov), the National Labor Relations Board (www.nlrb.gov), or the Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs (www.dol.gov/esa/ofccp). Nothing in this Arbitration Provision shall be deemed to preclude or excuse a party from bringing an administrative claim before any agency in order to fulfill the party's obligation to exhaust administrative remedies before making a claim in arbitration;</p>

<p>Disputes that may not be subject to pre-dispute arbitration agreement as provided by the Dodd-­‐Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Public Law 111-­‐203) are excluded from the coverage of this Arbitration Provision;</p>

<p>Disputes regarding your, Rideshare’s, or Rideshare’s intellectual property rights;</p>

<p>This Arbitration Provision shall not be construed to require the arbitration of any claims against a contractor that may not be the subject of a mandatory arbitration agreement as provided by section 8116 of the Department of Defense ("DoD") Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year 2010 (Pub. L. 111-­‐118), section 8102 of the Department of Defense ("DoD") Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year 2011 (Pub. L. 112-­ 10, Division A), and their implementing regulations, or any successor DoD appropriations act addressing the arbitrability of claims.</p>

<h3>iii.    Selecting The Arbitrator and Location of the Arbitration.</h3>

<p>The Arbitrator shall be selected by mutual agreement of Rideshare and you. Unless you and Rideshare mutually agree otherwise, the Arbitrator shall be an attorney licensed to practice in the location where the arbitration proceeding will be conducted or a retired federal or state judicial officer who presided in the jurisdiction where the arbitration will be conducted. If the Parties cannot agree on an Arbitrator, then an arbitrator will be selected using the alternate strike method from a list of five (5) neutral arbitrators provided by JAMS (Judicial Arbitration & Mediation Services). You will have the option of making the first strike. If a JAMS arbitrator is used, then the JAMS Streamlined Arbitration Rules & Procedures rules will apply. Those rules are available here:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.jamsadr.com/adr-rules-procedures/">https://www.jamsadr.com/adr-rules-procedures/</a></p>

<p>The location of the arbitration proceeding shall be no more than 45 miles from the place where you last provided transportation services under this Agreement, unless each party to the arbitration agrees in writing otherwise.</p>

<h3>iv. Starting The Arbitration.</h3>

<p>All claims in arbitration are subject to the same statutes of limitation that would apply in court. The party bringing the claim must demand arbitration in writing and deliver the written demand by hand or first-class mail to the other party within the applicable statute of limitations period. The demand for arbitration shall include identification of the Parties, a statement of the legal and factual basis of the claim(s), and a specification of the remedy sought. Any demand for arbitration made to Rideshare shall be provided to Rideshare MNM Technologies LLC, 2219 Rosemont Ave, Chicago, IL 60659. The arbitrator shall resolve all disputes regarding the timeliness or propriety of the demand for arbitration. A party may apply to a court of competent jurisdiction for temporary or preliminary injunctive relief in connection with an arbitrable controversy, but only upon the ground that the award to which that party may be entitled may be rendered ineffectual without such provisional relief.</p>

<h3>v.  How Arbitration Proceedings Are Conducted.</h3>

<p>In arbitration, the Parties will have the right to conduct adequate civil discovery, bring dispositive motions, and present witnesses and evidence as needed to present their cases and defenses, and any disputes in this regard shall be resolved by the Arbitrator.</p>

<p><strong>You and Rideshare agree to resolve any dispute in arbitration on an individual basis only, and not on a class, collective, or private attorney general representative action basis. The Arbitrator shall have no authority to consider or resolve any claim or issue any relief on any basis other than an individual basis.</strong> If at any point this provision is determined to be unenforceable, the parties agree that this provision shall not be severable, unless it is determined that the Arbitration may still proceed on an individual basis only.</p>

<p>While Rideshare will not take any retaliatory action in response to any exercise of rights you may have under Section 7 of the National Labor Relations Act, if any, Rideshare shall not be precluded from moving to enforce its rights under the FAA to compel arbitration on the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement.</p>

<h3>vi. Paying For The Arbitration.</h3>

<p>Each party will pay the fees for his, her or its own attorneys, subject to any remedies to which that party may later be entitled under applicable law (i.e., a party prevails on a claim that provides for the award of reasonable attorney fees to the prevailing party). In all cases where required by law, Rideshare will pay the Arbitrator's and arbitration fees. If under applicable law Rideshare is not required to pay all of the Arbitrator’s and/or arbitration fees, such fee(s) will be apportioned equally between the Parties or as otherwise required by applicable law. Any disputes in that regard will be resolved by the Arbitrator.</p>

<h3>vii.    The Arbitration Hearing And Award.</h3>

<p>The Parties will arbitrate their dispute before the Arbitrator, who shall confer with the Parties regarding the conduct of the hearing and resolve any disputes the Parties may have in that regard. Within 30 days of the close of the arbitration hearing, or within a longer period of time as agreed to by the Parties or as ordered by the Arbitrator, any party will have the right to prepare, serve on the other party and file with the Arbitrator a brief. The Arbitrator may award any party any remedy to which that party is entitled under applicable law, but such remedies shall be limited to those that would be available to a party in his or her individual capacity in a court of law for the claims presented to and decided by the Arbitrator, and no remedies that otherwise would be available to an individual in a court of law will be forfeited by virtue of this Arbitration Provision. The Arbitrator will issue a decision or award in writing, stating the essential findings of fact and conclusions of law. Except as may be permitted or required by law, as determined by the Arbitrator, neither a party nor an Arbitrator may disclose the existence, content, or results of any arbitration hereunder without the prior written consent of all Parties. A court of competent jurisdiction shall have the authority to enter a judgment upon the award made pursuant to the arbitration. The Arbitrator shall not have the power to commit errors of law or legal reasoning, and the award may be vacated or corrected on appeal to a court of competent jurisdiction for any such error.</p>

<h3>viii.   Your Right To Opt Out Of Arbitration.</h3>

If you do not want to be subject to this Arbitration Provision, you may opt out of this Arbitration Provision by notifying Rideshare in writing of your desire to opt out of this Arbitration Provision, either by (1) sending, within 30 days of the date this Agreement is executed by you, electronic mail to optout@ourrideshare.com, stating your name and intent to opt out of the Arbitration Provision or (2) by sending a letter by U.S. Mail, or by any nationally recognized delivery service (e.g, UPS, Federal Express, etc.), or by hand delivery to:</p>

Except as stated in subsection v, above, in the event any portion of this Arbitration Provision is deemed unenforceable, the remainder of this Arbitration Provision will be enforceable.</p>
